The application creates a map showing H1B visa related information across different states in US.The data is available for the period between October 1, 2014 through March 30, 2015. It can be downloaded from [here](http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/docs/py2015q2/H-1B_FY15_Q2.xlsx) along with the [Codebook](http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/docs/py2015q2/H-1B_FY15_Record_Layout.doc)

Given the size of dataset (~80mb) the xlsx file is converted to csv and only relevent columns are extracted from it into a datatable.
